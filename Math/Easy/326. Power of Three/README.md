# 326. Power of Three

## Problem Statement

Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3^x.

## Solution Explained

The easiest solution to this problem is to initialise a variable, _i_ as 1 and then keep multiplying it by 3 while it is less than n and checking equality in each iteration.

This is the same solution as the one used in [Power of Two](https://github.com/tintindas/leetcode-solutions/tree/main/Math/Easy/231.%20Power%20of%20Two).
